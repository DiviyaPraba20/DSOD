          TNMG accepts advertising on DSODentist from third parties ("Sponsors"), which may include third-party banners, badges, contextual advertising,
          and content created or provided by a Sponsor (collectively referred to as "Advertisements" or "Advertising").
          In addition, as used in this policy, the terms "Advertising" and "Advertisements" include third-party banners, modules, links, microsites, native advertisements,
          and other content provided by or on behalf of Sponsors.
          The Sponsor is responsible for the accuracy and objectivity of their Advertising.
          The following guidelines have been established by TNMG to govern various aspects of Advertising on properties within the TNMG Platform (each a "TNMGPlatform"),
          which include websites and mobile applications such as the DSODentist directed to dental professionals, which we refer to as the "TNMG Professional Properties."
          <br><br>

          The guidelines in this policy govern issues like acceptance of Advertisements by TNMG, how Advertisements are displayed on the TNMGPlatforms, and the removal of Advertisements from TNMGPlatforms.
          TNMG has sole and absolute discretion with respect to interpretation and enforcement of this policy and all other issues associated with Advertising on TNMGPlatforms.
          TNMG may change this policy at any time in its sole discretion by posting a revised policy to the applicable TNMG Platform.

          <b>1.</b> TNMG has sole discretion for determining the types of Advertising that will be accepted and displayed on aTNMGPlatform,
          and under no circumstances will TNMG's acceptance of any Advertisement be considered an endorsement of the product(s)
          and/or service(s) advertised or for the company that advertises, manufactures, distributes, or promotes the products or services.
          <br><br>

          <b>2.</b> TNMG will not knowingly accept Advertising that, in TNMG's opinion, is not factually accurate and in good taste.
          <br><br>

              advertising units that mimic computer functions or deceptively indicate a computer or other function that would be reasonable to the average user to assume as a reason to click the unit
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>4.</b> TNMG recognizes and maintains a distinct separation between Advertising and TNMG's editorial content.
          All Advertising on aTNMG Platform will be clearly and unambiguously identified.
          TNMG will not allow any Advertising on the DSODentist Platform that is not identified with the label of "Advertisement", "From Our Sponsor", "Information From Industry"
          or a similar designation indicating that the Advertising is being provided by or on behalf of a Sponsor.
          <br><br>

          <b>5.</b> A click on an Advertisement may only link the end user to the Sponsor's site or to relevant sponsored content area on a TNMG Property.
          <br><br>

          <b>6.</b> TNMG retains the exclusive right to determine how any and all search results for specific information by keyword or
          topic are displayed on a TNMG Property based on TNMG-delivered search results.
          Content listed in search results is displayed with its source, e.g., "TNMG News" or "Journal Article."
          If Advertising appears in the search results, it is labeled as such.
          <br><br>

          <b>7.</b> TNMG reserves the right to decide at any time in its sole discretion whether it will accept, reject, cancel, or remove Advertising from aTNMG Platform.
          TNMG cannot provide any assurances that Advertisements will perform without error on all platforms, including websites and mobile applications.
          <br><br>

          <b>8.</b> It is the Sponsor's responsibility to comply with all domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to its Advertising within the DSODentist Platform
          (and to include all legally required legends, disclosures and statements in such Advertising),
          including without limitation the current FDA guidelines for Direct to Physician (DTP) and Direct to Consumer (DTC) advertising.
          TNMG will not monitor compliance with such laws and regulations.
          However, TNMG reserves the right to review all Advertising for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and,
          if TNMG becomes aware of any breach or potential breach of any applicable law or regulation or of these guidelines,
          TNMG may remove the Advertising from the TNMG Platform.
          <br><br>

          <b>9.</b> No Advertising on aTNMG Platform shall include any pixels, tags, flash containers or any other type of information collection software code
          (any such pixel, tag, code or device a "Pixel") or shall place any beacons, cookies or other information collection devices on the browsers of users of
          the DSODentist Platform unless expressly approved in writing by TNMG.
          If TNMG approves the inclusion of a Pixel in an advertisement, then unless and only to the extent that such approval contains an express exception,
          <ul>
            <li>
              (i) Sponsor may not use such Pixel to collect any personally-identifiable information (PII) with respect to any TNMG user,
            </li>
            <li>
              (ii) no such Pixel can be Flash- or object-based,
            </li>
            <li>
              (iii) the Pixel can be blocked and any cookie placed can be deleted by user browser settings,
            </li>
            <li>
              (iv) Sponsor will not link any non-PII that it collects to any PII that it may have from any other source and
            </li>
            <li>
              (v) Sponsor will not update any existing profile or create any profile in its database based on any data collected on the DSODentist Platform,
              including the fact that someone is a TNMG user or any information derived from the information in the referring URL.
            </li>
          </ul>
